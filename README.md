This is a script to generate NuSMV and Matlab code for Mode Transitions

Mode transitions defined as tables can be easily converted to Matlab and NuSMV code for use in SDV and NuSMV tool. This is used for formally proving the correctness of the mode transition. Two examples - one an earlier autopilot mode transition and another generic table is provided.
